                <p>Qatari cuisine is made up of traditional Arab cuisine.[1] MachbÅ«s, a meal consisting of rice, meat, and vegetables, is the national dish in Qatar, typically made with either lamb or chicken and is slow-cooked to give it a depth of flavour.[[2][1] Seafood and dates are staple food items in the country.[3] Many of these dishes are also used in other countries in the region, because they share many commonalities. In other parts of the region some of the dishes have different names or use slightly different ingredients.</p>
